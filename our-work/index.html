                                    We met Toby Thomas, the owner of Imperial Plumbing, because our kitchen floors were squishy. We live in an older, pier and beam home and the plywood under our kitchen floor had gotten soaked with water. A slow drip from the water heater drain valve caused a puddle of water in its closet and squishy floors. You can read more about the story in <a href="http://blog.shepherddog.co/2015/03/16/releasing-our-first-client-project---imperial-plumbing/">the blog post we wrote about it</a>.
                                </p>
                                <img alt="Screenshot of Imperial Plumbing Website"
                                     src="/media/imperial-plumbing-home.png" />
                                <p>
                                    We built the site by hand to the latest web standards and optimized it so it loads super quickly. We started from scratch rather than trying to stuff the identity of Imperial Plumbing into someone else’s site.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But that all comes standard. The real difference is that we dove into the topic of plumbing and learned a lot. Toby was there to help – like with tips like this one about not using a plunger that I’d never heard before – but we also had to learn it ourselves. I had to read the plumbing codes in the cities that Imperial Plumbing serves. We had to learn about the unique challenges that a plumbing company faces that other companies don’t. We had to learn what people are looking for when they go to a plumbing company website.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you only notice one thing about the site, we hope you notice its depth. It is not a thin layer of content pasted over pretty pictures. It has all the higher level information you’d want instantly – a big phone number at the top and a map of the company’s service area on the side. But it also has information about the steps to go through to make sure your plumber is legit and tells you what it will be like to work with Imperial Plumbing. It even has information about the plumbing codes for each of the 39 cities that Toby serves. Did you know that the city you live in can impact how much it costs to have a plumber replace your water heater? I didn’t before this project. For example, in Denton a residence must have a carbon monoxide detector outside of each bedroom if it has an attached garage or gas appliances.
                                </p>
                                <img alt="Screenshot of Imperial Plumbing Website"
                                     src="/media/imperial-plumbing-denton.png" />
                                <p>
                                    That’s depth of information. And while we definitely consulted Toby’s expertise, we did a lot of the work ourselves to figure out what the site needed to say. Toby was able to carry on his business while we took care of his technology.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You want to know my favorite part of building this? Seeing Toby’s excitement. As we moved through the project Toby came up with great ideas and we could feel his excitement building. We were showing him what could be done with technology. We were showing how doing a little more work with it could deliver more than a marketing tool towards customers, more than a way of educating people about plumbing, his team could use the same information to be able to do their job easier and better. At one point I was so happy to be able to do this work that I was brought to tears. I love technology and it is so awesome to be able to share that love.
                                </p>
