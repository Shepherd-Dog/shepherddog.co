                            Here are things we've built recently:

                            <h3>
                                Pender's Music Co. iOS App
                            </h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    We're sharing some screenshots here, but you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penders/id1001642969?mt=8" target="_blank">download the app</a> to get a better feel of how it works, and to look up your favorite sheet music by its barcode.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This app, Pender’s Barcode Scanner, has a simple but powerful concept. If you’ve ever been in a sheet music store, you know that music is everywhere. But you can’t hear it easily, you can read it and imagine what it will sound like, but it is all just paper.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This app lets you scan a barcode on that paper and hear what the music will sound like when played with just a couple of taps.
                                </p>
                                <img alt="Screenshot of Pender's Barcode Scanner iOS App"

                                <p>
                                    The best part of this app is that it is focused on making Pender’s Music Co.’s customers’ lives easier. That is the reason companies should create apps – to better serve their customers.

                                    Leslie Forsyth, the owner of Healing Arts, is my mom. Most of my life she has been the breadwinner of the household and for years she has owned her own business. She shared her entrepreneurial spirit with me and has always shown that she, and therefore I, can overcome any obstacles placed in her path. You can read more about the story in <a href="http://blog.shepherddog.co/2015/08/20/healing-arts/">the blog post we wrote about it</a>.
                                </p>
                                <img alt="Screenshot of Healing Arts Website"

                                <p>
                                    We built the site by hand to the latest web standards and optimized it so it loads super quickly (even with all the high quality, colorful images!). We started from scratch rather than trying to stuff Leslie's into someone else’s site.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But that all comes standard. The real difference is the amount of effort we put into achieving our two main goals: 1) Highlight the owner, Leslie Forsyth, and her unique personality, and 2) Describe complex therapies in a simple, warm, human story that anyone can relate to.
                                </p>
                                <img alt="Screenshot of Healing Arts Website"

                                <p>
                                    To keep the story about these therapies warm we took all of the pictures ourselves. We wanted to be sure to get warm skin tones to emphasize the human aspect of health – something you don't usually think of when you picture the sterile white of going to a doctor's office or hospital.

                                    We met Toby Thomas, the owner of Imperial Plumbing, because our kitchen floors were squishy. We live in an older, pier and beam home and the plywood under our kitchen floor had gotten soaked with water. A slow drip from the water heater drain valve caused a puddle of water in its closet and squishy floors. You can read more about the story in <a href="http://blog.shepherddog.co/2015/03/16/releasing-our-first-client-project---imperial-plumbing/">the blog post we wrote about it</a>.
                                </p>
                                <img alt="Screenshot of Imperial Plumbing Website"
                                     src="/media/imperial-plumbing-home.png" />

                                    We built the site by hand to the latest web standards and optimized it so it loads super quickly. We started from scratch rather than trying to stuff the identity of Imperial Plumbing into someone else’s site.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But that all comes standard. The real difference is that we dove into the topic of plumbing and learned a lot. Toby was there to help – like with tips like this one about not using a plunger that I’d never heard before – but we also had to learn it ourselves. I had to read the plumbing codes in the cities that Imperial Plumbing serves. We had to learn about the unique challenges that a plumbing company faces that other companies don’t. We had to learn what people are looking for when they go to a plumbing company website.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you only notice one thing about the site, we hope you notice its depth. It is not a thin layer of content pasted over pretty pictures. It has all the higher level information you’d want instantly – a big phone number at the top and a map of the company’s service area on the side. But it also has information about the steps to go through to make sure your plumber is legit and tells you what it will be like to work with Imperial Plumbing. It even has information about the plumbing codes for each of the 39 cities that Toby serves. Did you know that the city you live in can impact how much it costs to have a plumber replace your water heater? I didn’t before this project. For example, in Denton a residence must have a carbon monoxide detector outside of each bedroom if it has an attached garage or gas appliances.

                                    That’s depth of information. And while we definitely consulted Toby’s expertise, we did a lot of the work ourselves to figure out what the site needed to say. Toby was able to carry on his business while we took care of his technology.

                                    You want to know my favorite part of building this? Seeing Toby’s excitement. As we moved through the project Toby came up with great ideas and we could feel his excitement building. We were showing him what could be done with technology. We were showing how doing a little more work with it could deliver more than a marketing tool towards customers, more than a way of educating people about plumbing, his team could use the same information to be able to do their job easier and better. At one point I was so happy to be able to do this work that I was brought to tears. I love technology and it is so awesome to be able to share that love.
