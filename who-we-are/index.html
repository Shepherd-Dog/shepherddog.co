                    <p>
                        We love small businesses. We try to shop at small local stores, have work done to our house by local tradespeople, and eat at local restaurants as much as possible. We love knowing that someone in our community cares enough to take a risk and say "I can give back." Yes, small businesses have to make a profit to survive but we believe that at their heart is a desire to serve the community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also love non-profits. So much so that we offer a 50% discount on our hourly rate for them – we want as many dollars as possible to go towards their core mission so that they can make a bigger difference in the community. As you can read below in Brandy's bio, she started her work in a local non-profit museum. We know that non-profits do what they do for a good cause and that's what drives them forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that big business has an unfair advantage in the area of technology. They have people for everything – entire tech departments devoted to offering the latest things. Entire marketing departments analyzing the demographics that visit their sites and how to optimize the conversion rate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are only two people up against large teams, but we believe in the power of a small business. We believe that a small team can do just as well as a large team – actually even better because we can out-care them. We don't do things for you in the sake of efficiency. We do them to maximize care and attention. We want to do what we can to help you be the best business you can be.
                    </p>

                        Brandy found a passion for helping others as a teenager during her first job, which was of course in the customer service industry. She worked as a ticket office cashier at a local museum that brought a combination of education and entertainment to the community she grew up in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While following that passion for helping others she found herself in many diverse roles which seemed to have two underlying commonalities: 1) Dive in and get things done with little guidance, and 2) Understand and communicate (and often times train others on) complex processes to very diverse audiences (for example, the President of Marketing vs. a Software Developer).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout her career Brandy has held many different roles (Ticket Office Supervisor, Accounts Payable, HR/Accounting Assistant, Payroll Supervisor, Guest Services Manager, Account Manager, Implementation Project Manager, Software QA Tester, Technical Project Manager/BA) each requiring both the use of and training on various software applications. Experiencing first hand and watching the frustration of others when using these applications led her to her most recent roles analyzing business processes to identify and implement technical solutions for “real people.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After several years of being the analyst and project manager she realized she wanted to make more of an impact in both the projects she's working on and in her community. In partnering with David to form Shepherd Dog she hopes to make the lives of others around her just a little easier on a daily basis.

                        David Brunow defies classification. Throughout his life he has taken on many different types of roles and excelled at most of them (he wasn't very good at being a used car salesman). Lately, he has been consulting and building software for a large international company and building iOS apps. Before that, he held several different roles in a community bank: Audit Assistant, Compliance Officer, Bank Secrecy Act Officer, Assistant Vice President, Junior Executive Officer, Operations Manager, and Systems Administrator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each role has increased David's expertise. From his time as a Compliance Officer, he knows the language of regulatory documents and can read and understand how regulations affect all kinds of businesses. From his time as a Systems Administrator and through various side projects, he knows much about the hardware side of the technology world like servers, email, and mobile devices. From his time as a software developer and other various side projects, he knows all the parts of web and mobile programming. From his time as a Generator Mechanic and soldier in the United States Army he knows discipline and how to read schematics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        David's most valuable asset is that he has learned a framework for figuring out new things. New problems are always coming up, driven by changes in technology, regulation, and everything else in our world. David has repeatedly shown that he can solve those problems.

                    <p>
                        We are Shepherd Dog for a few reasons:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, we have a shepherd mutt named Dozer that is our pet and our mascot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, shepherd dogs have an intense drive to take care of their charges and guide them in the right direction. We feel that we fill a similar role for our clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third, we strive to be like a shepherd dog in our work – shepherd dogs are strong, loyal, smart, focused, attentive, hard-working, driven, and proud. These are traits which we want to embody.
