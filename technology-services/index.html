                            We've tried, but we cannot think of a single business that won't benefit from using technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fortunately our society as a whole is getting better at technology while at the same time technology companies are realizing that making it easy to use is a great selling feature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Small business and non-profit owners can easily setup an email account, a website, and a payments or donations system for themselves for small amounts of money. Many small businesses don't need more than that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But some do need more. And beyond the basics, technology decisions can become time consuming and exhausting. That's where we want to help and here are some of the ways we can.

                                    As you know, you can build your site through any number of drag and drop editing tools through numerous online services for a small monthly rate. We think that is fantastic. But at a certain point you may outgrow those templates or not have time to make an update.
                                </p>

                                    We can help. So you can budget, a simple website will start around $3,000 ($1,500 for non-profits.) If that's more than you can afford right now then call us anyway â€“ we can meet at no charge to talk about your options for setting up your own site.

                                    You already have a great site but you have no idea who is visiting it. Or you have already setup an analytics package but it takes too much time to analyze the data and take action on it. Or the rest of your business gets in the way of you making updates to your site â€“ it is still showing a special from 5 months ago and has a copyright of 2012.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We can put a plan into place to look at the data for you, analyze it, and present you with our findings. In addition, we'll regularly review your site (at least monthly) and update things like your copyright or bring your attention to items that might need updating. If you give us the go-ahead, we'll make those changes as part of the maintenance plan.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our maintenance plans start at $150 a month per site ($75 a month per site for non-profits) which is the cost for small to medium sized sites. We'll need to assess the specific needs to come up with a monthly cost for larger sites. If this is too much for you right now, call us and we can meet at no charge to talk through setting up your own plan.

                                    When building new websites or applications testing to ensure everything is working properly before users or customers have access to it is critical. If a potential customer comes to your website and the page will not load, or the phone number is incorrect, they may never reach you. Or if you have a new web application displaying an error message and it wonâ€™t let you move forward to finish what youâ€™re trying to do, this can add a great amount of stress and frustration to your environment.
                                </p>

                                    Weâ€™ll be in close contact with you to get your feedback throughout the build of your site or application, however weâ€™ll never expect you to do the technical testing of it. We provide full testing for everything we build to ensure they work on the most frequently used web browsers and mobile devices. We may need your help to ensure all of your information is correct, however we understand that youâ€™re busy running your business and wouldnâ€™t want to add a task of this size to your list.

                                    We try to make everything we build as user-friendly and intuitive as possible. But sometimes the problem we are solving is just too complicated or a business has seasonal employees and will need to be able to teach them to use a tool without hiring us to do training every three months.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As an additional service, we can provide documentation on how to use the software that we've built for you. We do this as an additional service because not everyone will need it so we will only include the time to write it when necessary.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We can also write documentation for software we didn't build. For example, if you want us to write down the best workflow for using an online marketplace to list your artwork we can do the research and write the documentation for your specific needs. Or we may point you to documentation that has already been provided by that marketplace if it will suit your needs and save you some money.

                                    Most small businesses have a handful of software products they use daily to get their work done. Each piece of the puzzle comes from a different vendor and needs human intervention to smooth the edges between them so that theyâ€™ll work together.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We can help with this in different ways. Maybe we can build a small workflow tool that smooths those edges without manual intervention. Or maybe we need to build a custom web-based application to fit your particular business' specific needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This type of solution is custom designed to fit the specific needs of your company so itâ€™s is not cheap. You will need to be prepared to continue to invest in the software for maintenance and the addition of features as your needs or goals change. The up-front cost is only one part of the cost. Therefore this solution is not right for most small businesses but it can make a dramatic difference in the right ones.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Web application development can vary wildly in price based upon your needs. As with all projects with us, we are happy to provide a free estimate once we know the details of your project. Without any more information, this type of project will probably start around $10,000 ($5,000 for non-profits) for the initial build.

                                    Most small businesses should not build an iPhone/iPad (iOS) app. That probably sounds strange â€“ in the section where we are telling you that we build iOS apps we are trying to talk you out of building one. Yep, that's what we are doing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Why shouldn't a small business build an iOS app? Because in most circumstances it is expensive and the payoff is not always worth it. iOS apps will cost as much or more to build as a web application but the maintenance cost is much higher. Unlike the web â€“ which has standards that are in place for years, if not decades, before being updated â€“ iOS is updated every year. That means that something might change to make your existing app look outdated. Or worse, something might change that breaks your app in the new version.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    iOS apps also don't do a whole lot unless they are connected to a web application to feed them new and changing data. If you don't already have a web applicaiton, it may mean we would need to build both, adding to the overall cost of this tool. And considering maintenance and effort to ensure everything works together, costs start to add up quickly!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you have your heart set on building an iOS app we'd still love to talk to you about it. Maybe we can talk you out of it. Maybe you already understand all of these concerns but you know how you are going to make it worthwhile. Maybe you know that if you take the up-front cost of building it that you can sell it to others in your industry or sell advertising inside it. Or maybe you see an investment in an iOS app being similar to an investment in a store front.
                                </p>
