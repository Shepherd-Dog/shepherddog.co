                            We've tried, but we cannot think of a single business that won't benefit from using technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fortunately our society as a whole is getting better at technology while at the same time technology companies are realizing that making it easy to use is a great selling feature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Small business and non-profit owners can easily setup an email account, a website, and a payments or donations system for themselves for small amounts of money. Many small businesses don't need more than that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But some do need more. And beyond the basics, technology decisions can become time consuming and exhausting. That's where we want to help and here are some of the ways we can.

                                    Starting a business requires a lot of thought up front â€“ legal documents, accounting decisions, maybe finding a location for a shop, and maybe hiring employees. Plus, no matter what business you start today you have to think about technology. You need to have an email address, maybe a website, and maybe some social media accounts. The process can be overwhelming.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We can help. If you're starting a business and just want someone to talk to about your basic technology needs, we'd be happy to sit down with you and share our advice for free. You don't pay unless you decide you want us to do something for you, like register a domain, setup email, or build a website.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As you may know, you can build your own site through any number of drag and drop editing tools through various online services for a small monthly rate. We think that is fantastic. But at a certain point you may outgrow those templates or not have time to keep it updated. Or maybe even the thought of going through a template is more than you want to take on right now.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We can help. So you can budget, websites will start around $400 for a templated site something like <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" target="_blank">WordPress</a> or <a href="http://www.squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> or $3,000 for a simple custom website (half of those prices for non-profits.) If that's more than you can afford right now then call us anyway â€“ we can meet at no charge to talk about your options for setting up your own site.
                                </p>

                                    You already have a great site but you have no idea who is visiting it. Or you have already setup an analytics package but it takes too much time to analyze the data and take action on it. Or the rest of your business gets in the way of you making updates to your site â€“ it is still showing a special from 5 months ago and has a copyright of 2012.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We can put a plan into place to look at the data for you, analyze it, and present you with our findings. In addition, we'll regularly review your site (at least monthly) and update things like your copyright or bring your attention to items that might need updating. If you give us the go-ahead, we'll make those changes as part of the maintenance plan.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our maintenance plans start at $300 a month per site ($150 a month per site for non-profits) which is the cost for small to medium sized sites. We'll need to assess the specific needs to come up with a monthly cost for larger sites. If this is too much for you right now, call us and we can meet at no charge to talk through setting up your own plan.
                                </p>

                                    When we first launched our company and this site, we advised that most small businesses should not build an app. Since then, we've worked on a couple of great apps that businesses are building to better serve their customers and we have to eat our words and change that initial advice.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Apps are a fantastic way to make your customers' or employees' lives easier. Whether it is an app that tracks reward points for a local coffee shop, a barcode scanner that helps customers find what they are looking for easier, or a tool that your employees can use to make their job easier, more efficient, and more accurate, a world where we all have an amazing computer in our pockets has made apps very powerful.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    App development can be expensive. We do what we can to minimize those costs. We always provide a written estimate at the beginning of a project and we don't charge above that estimate. Even better, we track the actual hours and if it takes less time than we estimated then you only pay for the actual hours worked. We want you to know what you are going to pay at the start of a project and we don't ever want to surprise you with a charge.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another way we can minimize your costs is if we can build a more generic version of an app for your industry. Let's say you're a dry cleaner and you want an app that allows your customers to track your daily deliveries. If you team up with the other local small businesses providing dry cleaning services then we can build an app that suits all of your needs and charge each of you lower amounts. You still get an app with your logo and name on it and you still get the technology that can keep you competitive with the big national companies.
