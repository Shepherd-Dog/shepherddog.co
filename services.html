                        We've tried, but we cannot think of a single business that won't benefit from using technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fortunately our society as a whole is getting better at technology while at the same time technology companies are realizing that making it easy to use is a great selling feature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Small business owners can easily setup an email account, a website, and payments system for themselves for small amounts of money. Many small businesses don't need more than that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But some do need more. And beyond the basics, technology decisions can become time consuming and exhausting. That's where we want to help and here are some of the ways we can.

                                As you know, you can build your site through any number of drag and drop editing tools through numerous online services for a small monthly rate. We think that is fantastic. But at a certain point you may outgrow those templates or not have time to make an update.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can help. So you can budget, a simple website will start around $3,000 ($1,500 for non/not-for-profits.) If that's more than you can afford right now then call us anyway – we can meet at no charge to talk about your options for setting up your own site.

                                You already have a great site but you have no idea who is visiting it. Or you have already setup an analytics package but it takes too much time to analyze the data and take action on it. Or the rest of your business gets in the way of you making updates to your site – it is still showing a special from 5 months ago and has a copyright of 2012.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can put a plan into place to look at the data for you, analyze it, and present you with our findings. In addition, we'll regularly review your site (at least monthly) and update things like your copyright or bring your attention to items that might need updating. If you give us the go-ahead, we'll make those changes as part of the maintenance plan.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our maintenance plans are $150 a month per site ($75 a month per site for non/not-for-profits.) If this is too much for you right now, call us and we can meet at no charge to talk through setting up your own plan.

                                When building new websites or applications testing to ensure everything is working properly before users or customers have access to it is critical. If a potential customer comes to your website and the page will not load, or the phone number is incorrect, they may never reach you. Or if you have a new web application displaying an error message and it won’t let you move forward to finish what you’re trying to do, this can add a great amount of stress and frustration to your environment.

                                We’ll be in close contact with you to get your feedback throughout the build of your site or application, however we’ll never expect you to do the technical testing of it. We provide full testing for everything we build to ensure they work on the most frequently used web browsers and mobile devices. We may need your help to ensure all of your information is correct, however we understand that you’re busy running your business and wouldn’t want to add a task of this size to your list.

                                Most small businesses have a handful of software products they use daily to get their work done. Each piece of the puzzle comes from a different vendor and needs human intervention to smooth the edges between them so that they’ll work together.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can help with this in different ways. Maybe we can build a small workflow tool that smooths those edges without manual intervention. Or maybe we need to build a custom web-based application to fit your particular business' specific needs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This type of solution is custom designed to fit the specific needs of your company so it’s is not cheap. You will need to be prepared to continue to invest in the software for maintenance and the addition of features as your needs or goals change. The up-front cost is only one part of the cost. Therefore this solution is not right for most small businesses but it can make a dramatic difference in the right ones.

                                Web application development can vary wildly in price based upon your needs. As with all projects with us, we are happy to provide a free estimate once we know the details of your project. Without any more information, this type of project will probably start at $10,000 ($5,000 for non/not-for-profits.)
